        title: 'Pulp Fiction – Tarantinos mesmeric thriller still breathtaking 20 years on',
        content: [
            `Twenty years on, Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction has been rereleased in 
            cinemas, and it looks as mesmeric and mad as ever: callous, insolent, 
            breathtaking. The icy wit, the connoisseur soundtrack, the violence (of 
            which the N-bombs are a part), the extended dialogue riffing, the 
            trance-like unreality, the inspired karmic balance of the heroin 
            scene and the adrenalin scene, the narrative switchbacks that allow 
            John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead, the spectacle of 
            him being made to dance badly, but also sort of brilliantly … above 
            all else, the sheer directionless excitement that only Tarantino can 
            conjure.`, 
            `In 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap, and in 1990s 
            Britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence 
            everywhere: movies, fiction, journalism, media, fashion, restaurants, 
            you name it. Everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness, but 
            without his brilliance it just looked smug. (The Americans get Tarantino; 
            we get Guy Ritchie and Jeremy Clarkson.) Travolta and Samuel L Jackson 
            play Vincent and Jules, a couple of bantering hitmen working for 
            Marsellus (Ving Rhames), who is highly protective of his wife, Mia 
            (Uma Thurman), and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match; 
            Marsellus's fighter, Butch (Bruce Willis), is haunted by a childhood 
            encounter with his late father's best friend (a jaw-dropping cameo from 
            Christopher Walken). Everyone's destiny plays out with that of a couple of 
            freaky stick-up artists, played by Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth.`,
            `In 1994, 
            all the talk was of former video-store clerk Tarantino's indifference to 
            traditional culture. That patronised his sophisticated cinephilia, and in 
            fact, 20 years on, the writerly influences of Edward Bunker, Elmore Leonard 
            and Jim Thompson seem very prominent. Don DeLillo began the 90s by warning 
            that the US is the only country in the world with funny violence. 
            Maybe Pulp Fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind. Unmissable.`,

        title: 'Inglorious Basterds',
        content: [
            `Quentin Tarantino's films are celebrations of cinema and, more specifically, 
            of popular genres and he is in love not only with their conventions but with 
            the American language which has been part of their fabric. His new film, 
            Inglourious Basterds, is a homage to the war movie, which became an entertainment 
            genre during the course of the Second World War as a vehicle for allied propaganda, 
            though the war was not, at least directly, a major concern of Goebbels's Nazi cinema.
            It continued when peace came, its heyday being the 1950s and 60s, but Tarantino's 
            inspiration was a schlocky Italian exploitation movie, Enzo G Castellari's 1978 Quel 
            maledetto treno blindato (That damned armoured train) that received a limited release 
            in the English-speaking world as The Inglorious Bastards. In Castellari's coarse, 
            clumsily plotted film, a bunch of American misfits on their way to a military prison 
            in France some weeks after D-Day escape from their guards. But they are then drawn 
            into a secret anti-German mission while heading for the Swiss border. Tarantino's 
            plotting is not that much more refined, but his film-making is and he follows the 
            original film in having the Germans, the French and the Americans speak their own 
            languages.`,
            `The film unfolds in five chapters and chapter one is as good as anything Tarantino 
            has done and is wonderfully lit by one of America's finest cinematographers, Robert 
            Richardson. The chapter is called "Once Upon a Time in German Occupied France, 1941", 
            its title, mood and Ennio Morricone music evoking the opening sequence of Sergio 
            Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West.`,
            `It's an idyllic day in rural France. A farmer is chopping wood outside his remote farm, 
            a small party of German troops on motorcycles approaches from the distance. Their leader 
            is SS Colonel Landa (a brilliant performance by Christoph Waltz), a suave, charismatic 
            sadist charged with hunting for fugitive Jews. As the camera circles around them, Land 
            interrogates the farmer LaPadite in a wheedling, menacingly playful, manipulative manner. 
            The tension resembles a violin string just before it snaps. Landa has been talking a 
            silkily fluent French, but suddenly suggests they talk in English. Is Tarantino 
            compromising by this language switch? No, it's part of Landa's deadly strategy of getting 
            LaPadite to betray himself. Suddenly violence erupts and the episode, shot in some 25 
            minutes of real time, ends with a dramatic link that isn't picked up until the third chapter.
            This opening is both entertaining and morally serious and one thinks of what Robert Warshow 
            wrote in his great essay The Westerner in 1953. "In war movies, it is possible to present 
            the uses of violence within a framework of responsibility," he remarked, adding: "At its best, 
            the war movie may represent a more civilised point of view than the western, and if it were 
            not continually marred by ideological sentimentality we might hope to find it developing into 
            a higher form of drama."`,
            `Ideological sentimentality is not a charge that could be made against Tarantino, but his film 
            thereafter, though consistently gripping, is uneven and fractured as it follows the revenge 
            motif set up in the first chapter. The second chapter, set two years later, introduces us to 
            the eponymous "inglourious basterds", a band of American Jewish soldiers sent to perpetrate 
            anti-Nazi atrocities in occupied France. They've been recruited by a Gentile from the Deep 
            South, Captain Aldo Raine, a name derived from the bull-necked actor Aldo Ray, star of such 
            war films as Battle Cry and The Naked and the Dead. Brad Pitt's Raine's opening address evokes 
            the mission speeches of George Scott's Patton and Lee Marvin's maverick major in The Dirty 
            Dozen, and this unlikely bunch torture their prisoners, beat them to death with baseball bats, 
            scalp them and carve swastikas on their foreheads. They become, as well they might, an 
            irritation to Hitler.`,
            `It is true that Hollywood studios were very cagey in the representation of Jews in wartime 
            movies. In 194O, Joseph Kennedy, the isolationist American ambassador to Britain, father of JFK, 
            had advised the Hollywood moguls to "get those Jewish names off the screen" and to "stop making 
            anti-Nazi pictures or using the film medium to promote or show sympathy to the cause of 
            'democracies' versus 'the dictators'." As late as 1944, Jack Warner, head of Warner Brothers, 
            told the producer of Objective Burma!: "I like the idea of a Jewish officer in Burma. See that 
            you get a clean-cut American type for Jacobs." But Tarantino's readjustment is a mindless, puerile 
            gesture, especially viewed in the light of Defiance, Edward Zwick's recent film about Jewish 
            guerrillas in Second World War Byelorussia.`,
            `The film's revenge theme takes an extraordinary turn in the later chapters set in 1944 between 
            D-Day and the liberation of Paris, when the Nazis decide to stage the world premiere of a patriotic 
            vie at a French cinema managed by the attractive Shosanna (Mélanie Laurent), the sole survivor of a 
            Jewish family. Churchill and a British general (played as a parody of a stereotype by Mike Myers) 
            send a British film critic with special knowledge of German cinema (Michael Fassbender) to collaborate 
            th the Basterds on destroying the Germany high command, Hitler, Goebbels, Bormann and Goering among 
            them, at this premiere, while Shosanna independently plans her own Götterdämmerung.
            The result, involving some slack and highly ingenious plotting, features a beautiful German movie 
            star working as a double agent and a German version of Audie Murphy, and invokes The Dirty Dozen, To 
            Be or Not to Be, The Last Metro and a dozen movies set in cinemas. The grand central conceit is that 
            those who worship and glorify movies but are unworthy of them (eg Goebbels) will die in a cinema. The 
            violence will spread from the screen into the auditorium and the fuel to burn them or ignite their 
            pyres will be provided by the inflammable material of film itself. The notion is as intoxicating as it 
            is demented.`,

            `It’s hardly surprising that this, perhaps the most “Tarantino-esque” 
            of all Quentin Tarantino’s movies to date, is a love letter to Hollywood. 
            Who has been more vocal about his passion for the movies, in all their 
            glorious (and inglourious) variety, than Tarantino? And who has been more 
            promiscuous with his affections, flirting with everything from grindhouse 
            and exploitation flicks to martial arts, westerns and second world war adventures?
            But cinema is a notoriously fickle mistress. And Tarantino is a man who clearly 
            relishes the concept of revenge.`,
            `Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a film that is as 
            much about the movie industry as it is about the Manson family crimes that rocked 
            it, is a work of infatuation, certainly. But if it’s a love letter, it’s the kind 
            tinged with the grasping anguish and stab of bitterness that comes from knowing 
            that the object of affection is almost certainly eyeing up a new favourite.
            Success in Hollywood comes with built-in obsolescence. It’s an industry with a vampiric 
            appetite for fresh blood. Actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio, signposting the 
            character’s vulnerability with a slight stutter) knows this, but that doesn’t make it any 
            easier to swallow. Formerly the lead in a wild west vigilante TV series, by 1969 Rick has 
            already started the slow slide into bad guy bit-parts and bourbon bloat. As a guest on new 
            shows, he allows himself to be bested each episode by the actors who are positioned as his 
            replacements. Wet-eyed with self-pity after a straight-talking producer lays out a road map 
            for his irrelevance, Rick hides behind the sunglasses of his confidant and former stuntman 
            Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Their friendship is a constant in an uncertain world. Their fates 
            are linked: “More than a buddy, less than a wife,” is how the film’s narration puts it.
            That fear of no longer being current, no longer getting the calls is something that infects 
            everyone who works in the movie industry to some degree or another. And you suspect that 
            Tarantino himself is not immune to it. A scene in which an awestruck child whispers to Rick: 
            “That was the best acting I have ever seen” is milked for manly tears. Meanwhile, young people 
            with a less reverent approach to their elders are dealt with swiftly and efficiently, with 
            the kind of sound design that emphasises the crunch of righteous fist into puny, snickering 
            hippy jaws.`,
            `This is a film set in a stunningly evoked Hollywood past. It can also be read as a 
            commentary on Hollywood present. It’s a present that has skewed dramatically over 
            the past couple of years, in which the balance of power has started to shift. And an 
            industry that has started to hold itself to account. With that in mind, Tarantino’s decision 
            to engineer audience support and sympathy for a character whose career has stalled because of 
            allegations of violence against a woman feels like a deliberate provocation and a petulant dig 
            at the #MeToo movement.It doesn’t help that the female characters tend towards the schematic and stereotypical. Through 
            sheer force of charm, Margot Robbie invests Sharon Tate, Rick Dalton’s Cielo Drive neighbour, 
            with more depth and subtlety than the gilded, angelic ideal that is sketched on the page. With 
            two notable exceptions – Margaret Qualley’s star-making skittish Manson girl and Julia Butters’s 
            precocious child actor – the majority of the other female characters fall into the categories of 
            either shrews or witches. It’s this – the positioning of middle-aged white males as the real 
            victims here, goddammit – that rankles.`,
            `Together with a troubling ending that, at the director’s 
            request, can’t be discussed, it makes the indulgences less easy to forgive. And there are many 
            indulgences: the baggy first hour; the unwieldy two-tier flashback that sets up Cliff’s backstory; 
            the jarring scene featuring Damian Lewis as a polyester version of Steve McQueen; the cheap shot at 
            Bruce Lee. But, equally, there is much here that represents a film-maker at the top of his game. 
            The delight he takes in the details that anchor the story in time and place: who else but Tarantino 
            would include entire montages dedicated to vintage fonts? The heart-tugging music choices; the limber 
            camerawork and tawny nostalgic warmth of Robert Richardson’s cinematography; every last juicy frame 
            set at the Manson family hideout at the Spahn Movie Ranch. It’s a film that could only have been made 
            by one man. Tarantino’s fear of replacement, the subtext of some of the more uneven passages in the 
            film, is, for the moment, unfounded.`,
